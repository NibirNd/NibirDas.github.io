They have also increased their economic integration and cooperation in various fields, such as trade, investment, finance, digital economy and sustainable development. However, despite their common aspirations and interests, they also face significant challenges and divergences in terms of their economic structures, policies and institutions. This paper examines whether BRICS can be considered as an optimum currency area (OCA), a region that would benefit from adopting a common currency or a fixed exchange rate regime. The paper applies the OCA theory and criteria to assess the degree of economic convergence and policy coordination among BRICS countries. The paper also analyzes the potential benefits and costs of forming a monetary union among BRICS countries, as well as the feasibility and desirability of such a project. The paper concludes that BRICS is not an OCA at present, due to the lack of sufficient economic integration, policy coordination and institutional harmonization among its members. Moreover, the paper argues that forming a monetary union among BRICS countries is neither feasible nor desirable at this stage, given the high costs and risks involved, as well as the alternative options available for enhancing their economic cooperation.</p><h3 id="dd5fa74c-b225-416a-8cb7-e2e28411646f" class=""><strong>Keywords:</strong> BRICS; optimum currency area; economic integration; policy coordination; monetary union.</h3><h2 id="c37f4c21-50c6-4959-9e2a-5ca73736b329" class=""><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p id="30457b1d-dfaa-41a8-8d0b-74c63a07e47e" class="">New state associations, such as regional and interregional organizations, have become popular as a result of globalization and regionalization. A prime example of such a partnership is BRICS, which unites five significant regional powers from four continents and five major civilizations. BRICS is an acronym for a bloc of emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The BRICS nations are all equally dissatisfied with the geopolitical situation as it currently stands and their respective positions in the current system of international relations. They collaborate in an effort to create a new, polycentric system of international relations as they pursue economic success, adequate social welfare, and increased personal political influence.</p><p id="c463d141-ca8f-4c09-b3ef-c9e7b8f959bb" class="">The term BRIC was coined in 2001 by Jim O&#x27;Neill, an economist at Goldman Sachs, who predicted that these four countries would become major drivers of global growth in the 21st century (O&#x27;Neill, 2001). In 2010, South Africa joined the group at China&#x27;s invitation, making it BRICS. According to the World Bank (2021), BRICS countries account for about 40% of the world population, 25% of the world GDP (in nominal terms), 30% of the world land area, 18% of the world trade volume, and 4 trillion US dollars of foreign exchange reserves.</p><p id="d4b7fb6d-f494-45b3-892a-62f9401fbb38" class="">Since 2009, BRICS countries have held annual summits to discuss various issues of common interest and cooperation. They have also established several institutions and mechanisms to enhance their economic and political ties within the bloc and with other developing countries. These include:</p><ul id="ef2d60f8-8c80-4e74-af79-b554a0716658" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The New Development Bank (NDB), which provides financing for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS countries and other emerging economies.</li></ul><ul id="15bad297-257a-407c-bb53-52e2a1270473" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), which provides mutual support for short-term balance of payments difficulties among BRICS countries.</li></ul><ul id="7aa80eab-6469-4c5f-b51c-1fc197e1d195" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The BRICS Business Council (BBC), which facilitates dialogue and partnership between the private sectors of BRICS countries.</li></ul><ul id="d58874e5-c774-4603-a04a-8662707855be" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The BRICS Think Tank Council (BTTC), which provides intellectual support and policy recommendations for BRICS cooperation.</li></ul><p id="246ae9b8-7e3c-4632-a8dc-4c835d783054" class="">BRICS countries have also advocated for a more democratic and multipolar world order that reflects their growing role and voice in global affairs. They have called for reforms in international institutions such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank to make them more representative and responsive to the needs and interests of developing countries. They have also supported multilateralism, regionalism, south-south cooperation, sustainable development, human rights, peace and security as key principles for global governance.</p><p id="6bdc0e8b-527c-41f1-8c9c-738590d12f11" class="">Integration is considered to be the deepest form of international economic cooperation. Financial integration is essential for nations to gain from economic growth through risk sharing, efficiency improvements in resource allocation, and decreases in transaction costs and macroeconomic volatility. Monetary integration is an essential component of financial integration and an influential proponent of a unified financial system. Optimum Currency Area (OCA) is a theory proposed by the economist R. Mundell which has been used extensively to estimate the costs of monetary integration. One of the most debated issues regarding BRICS cooperation is whether these countries should adopt a common currency or not. A common currency is a monetary arrangement where two or more countries share the same legal tender and exchange rate regime. A common currency can bring significant benefits to participating countries by reducing transaction costs, enhancing price transparency, facilitating trade and investment flows, promoting macroeconomic stability and fostering economic convergence. However, a common currency also entails significant costs and challenges for participating countries in terms of losing policy flexibility, competitiveness, and sovereignty. A common currency also requires a high degree of political commitment and institutional integration that may not be feasible or desirable for each country.</p><p id="0394742c-5df6-498d-94df-3d4cac9b0a71" class="">Therefore, the decision to adopt a common currency should be based on a careful assessment of the costs and benefits of such a move, as well as the readiness and willingness of each country to surrender some degree of autonomy and diversity for the sake of greater unity and efficiency. This assessment can be guided by the theory of optimum currency areas (OCA), which was developed by Robert Mundell in 1961.</p><p id="16478a48-67a2-43a7-ae67-8d86e1c621af" class="">BRICS countries are in talks to have their own monetary union. However, do they qualify to be an optimum currency area? To examine this, we have to check if all the conditions of OCA are satisfied.</p><h2 id="e5e6b0a0-6f9d-4251-9547-d4c906abfce6" class=""><strong>Criteria for Optimum Currency Area:</strong></h2><p id="fc98e718-c02a-497d-befe-8591e8eb80ba" class="">According to the theory of optimum currency areas, the optimal area for a system of fixed exchange rates, or a common currency, is one that is highly economically integrated. Economic integration means free flows of goods and services (trade), financial capital (assets) and physical capital, and workers/labour (immigration and emigration). There are four main criteria for an OCA:</p><ul id="091bbb2f-7739-4e12-9cd0-e612824b254e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">High labour mobility throughout the area: This means that workers can move freely across borders in search of better employment opportunities and living standards. This can help to adjust to asymmetric shocks (i.e., shocks that affect some countries more than others) by reallocating labour from depressed regions to booming regions, thereby reducing unemployment and income disparities.</li></ul><ul id="9d9e4519-c24a-41a5-b158-08530ea639a0" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Capital mobility and price and wage flexibility: This means that capital can flow freely across borders in search of higher returns and lower risks. This can also help to adjust to asymmetric shocks by reallocating capital from less productive sectors to more productive sectors, thereby enhancing efficiency and growth. Moreover, price and wage flexibility means that prices and wages can adjust quickly to changes in demand and supply conditions, thereby restoring equilibrium in the markets.</li></ul><ul id="ecc6ee39-b46c-433c-9d19-fd97ae7b4a5e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">A currency risk-sharing or fiscal mechanism: This means that there is a system of transfers or insurance among countries in the OCA to share risk across countries. This can help to cushion the impact of asymmetric shocks by providing financial support or compensation to countries that are adversely affected by such shocks, thereby reducing hardship and instability.</li></ul><ul id="eca57207-e775-45a7-a9d3-bfde4ada7b17" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Similar business cycles: This means that countries in the OCA have similar economic structures, policies, and shocks that affect them in similar ways. This can reduce the likelihood and severity of asymmetric shocks by ensuring that countries face similar economic conditions and challenges, thereby enhancing harmony and coordination.</li></ul><p id="6ad71e24-d181-4c61-9002-4d5408e3a1db" class="">Some economists also suggest a fifth criterion for an OCA:</p><ul id="6e3c46aa-0f54-444a-b578-422aa43a3a26" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Production diversification within the region: This means that countries in the OCA have diversified production structures that make them less vulnerable to sector-specific shocks. This can also reduce the likelihood and severity of asymmetric shocks by ensuring that countries have different sources of income and growth, thereby increasing resilience and stability.</li></ul><p id="2ffae1ca-2056-4399-915e-8e3b657d9db4" class="">This paper applies the OCA theory and criteria to assess the degree of economic integration, convergence and synchronization; the degree of asymmetric shocks; and the degree of policy coordination, fiscal transfers and labor mobility among BRICS countries. The paper also analyzes the potential benefits and costs of forming a monetary union among BRICS countries, as well as the feasibility and desirability of such a project. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature on BRICS economic integration and monetary cooperation; Section 3 examines whether BRICS meets the OCA criteria; Section 4 discusses the benefits and costs of forming a monetary union among BRICS countries; Section 5 evaluates the feasibility and desirability of forming a monetary union among BRICS countries; Section 6 concludes with some policy implications.</p><h2 id="d4b88619-83ec-4c55-acd7-780f1712e2f6" class=""><strong>Literature Review</strong></h2><p id="3f4f2888-f558-433e-848f-edf48462ac47" class="">The literature on BRICS economic integration and monetary cooperation can be divided into two strands: one strand focuses on describing and analyzing the current state and prospects of BRICS economic integration and cooperation, using various indicators and measures, such as trade, investment, finance, infrastructure, digital economy and sustainable development; the other strand focuses on exploring and proposing various scenarios and models of BRICS monetary cooperation, ranging from currency swap arrangements, regional payment systems, common currency baskets, to full-fledged monetary unions. The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of these two strands of literature.</p><p id="fa0f60e1-4777-4e5f-8139-2421f45de2f0" class="">The first strand of literature on BRICS economic integration and cooperation can be further divided into two sub-strands: one sub-strand adopts a descriptive and positive approach to analyze the current state and trends of BRICS economic integration and cooperation, using various indicators and measures; the other sub-strand adopts a normative and prescriptive approach to evaluate the potential and challenges of BRICS economic integration and cooperation, using various criteria and benchmarks. Some examples of the first sub-strand are: Hooijmaaijers (2021), who examines the bilateral economic relations among BRICS countries in terms of trade, investment and construction contracts from 2009 to 2019; Chatterjee and Naka (2022), who analyze the political and economic transformations of BRICS countries through the lens of land; Käkönen (2019a), who provides an overview of BRICS cooperation in various fields, such as trade, investment, finance, energy, climate change and security; Lukin (2019a), who assesses the achievements and prospects of BRICS cooperation in areas such as global governance reform, development assistance, digital economy and human rights. Some examples of the second sub-strand are: Stuenkel (2015), who evaluates the impact and potential of BRICS cooperation on global order; Roberts et al. (2017), who examine the challenges and opportunities for BRICS cooperation in terms of institutionalization, representation and legitimacy; Kirton and Larionova (2018), who measure the compliance and performance of BRICS countries with their summit commitments; Hooijmaaijers and Keukeleire (2016), who compare BRICS with other regional groupings in terms of their degree of institutionalization.</p><p id="56c8fb4a-6679-438e-b6c3-1d09c849e927" class="">The second strand of literature on BRICS monetary cooperation can also be further divided into two sub-strands: one sub-strand adopts a descriptive and positive approach to analyze the current state and trends of BRICS monetary cooperation, using various indicators and measures; the other sub-strand adopts a normative and prescriptive approach to explore and propose various scenarios and models of BRICS monetary cooperation, ranging from currency swap arrangements, regional payment systems, common currency baskets, to full-fledged monetary unions. Some examples of the first sub-strand are: Nogueira Batista (2021), who assesses the progress and shortcomings of the BRICS financing mechanisms, namely the CRA and the NDB; Duggan et al. (2022), who examine the challenges and opportunities for BRICS cooperation in global governance and South-South cooperation; Arapova (2019), who analyzes the role and impact of the BRICS CRA on global financial stability; Rewizorski (2019), who evaluates the performance and potential of the BRICS NDB on development finance. Some examples of the second sub-strand are: Zhang et al. (2015), who propose a common currency basket system for BRICS countries based on a dynamic weighted average method; Liu et al. (2017), who explore a scenario of a BRICS monetary union with a common currency named “BRICSO”; Käkönen (2019b), who suggest a regional payment system for BRICS countries based on a digital currency platform; Lukin (2019b), who advocate a gradual approach to BRICS monetary integration based on enhancing policy coordination and institutional harmonization.</p><p id="370a490e-0f26-4b9d-b833-d0d6c6399aab" class="">The literature review shows that there is a rich and diverse body of research on BRICS economic integration and monetary cooperation, covering various aspects and dimensions of this topic. However, there is also a gap in the literature, as most of the existing studies do not explicitly apply the OCA theory and criteria to assess whether BRICS can be considered as an OCA, a region that would benefit from adopting a common currency or a fixed exchange rate regime. Moreover, most of the existing studies do not systematically analyze the potential benefits and costs of forming a monetary union among BRICS countries, as well as the feasibility and desirability of such a project. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this gap by applying the OCA theory and criteria to assess whether BRICS meets the OCA criteria; and by systematically analyzing the potential benefits and costs of forming a monetary union among BRICS countries, as well as the feasibility and desirability of such a project.</p><h2 id="fc4aaf8e-8742-45b2-9470-c329deb174e6" class=""><strong>Is BRICS an Optimum Currency Area?</strong></h2><p id="9939e2da-8aa2-4ee5-993d-65828ebbcd71" class="">In this section, we apply the OCA theory and criteria to assess whether BRICS can be considered as an OCA, a region that would benefit from adopting a common currency or a fixed exchange rate regime. We use various indicators and data sources to measure the degree of economic integration, convergence and synchronization; the degree of asymmetric shocks; and the degree of policy coordination, fiscal transfers and labor mobility among BRICS countries. We also compare BRICS with other existing or proposed OCAs, such as the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the East Asian Economic Community (EAEC), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).</p><h3 id="ae9aa2ce-218a-44ac-a612-15eda5ad9cc0" class=""><strong>Economic Integration, Convergence and Synchronization</strong></h3><p id="ca635f72-ae96-4385-b830-6b731d5f2f64" class="">One of the main criteria for an OCA is a high degree of economic integration, convergence and synchronization among its members. This implies that the countries share similar economic structures, policies and institutions; that they have a high volume of trade and investment flows among themselves; that they have similar levels of income per capita and inflation rates; and that they have synchronized business cycles and growth rates. A high degree of economic integration, convergence and synchronization can reduce the likelihood and magnitude of asymmetric shocks; increase the benefits of eliminating exchange rate fluctuations and transaction costs; and enhance the credibility and effectiveness of a common monetary policy.</p><p id="fbd4cc34-d216-4b5b-99e3-51759b9854df" class="">To measure the degree of economic integration, convergence and synchronization among BRICS countries, we use various indicators and data sources, such as trade intensity index, intra-BRICS trade share, foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and stocks, GDP per capita (PPP), inflation rate, real effective exchange rate (REER), business cycle correlation and growth rate correlation. We also compare BRICS with other existing or proposed OCAs, such as the EMU, the EAEC, and the GCC.</p><p id="d143c17e-8ef3-49bd-9bd3-7003bb71079b" class="">

Russia is heavily dependent on oil and gas exports, which are subject to geopolitical risks and price fluctuations. India is heavily dependent on service exports, which are subject to demand fluctuations and regulatory barriers. China is heavily dependent on manufacturing exports, which are subject to competition and demand fluctuations.

Monetary policy coordination can enhance economic integration by reducing currency volatility, mitigating external shocks, facilitating trade and investment flows, and promoting regional financial development.</p><p id="1569550e-ef63-464f-a241-3bb969d4fd50" class="">BRICS countries have taken some steps to coordinate their monetary policies in recent years. For instance, they have established the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), a multilateral currency swap agreement that provides short-term liquidity support to member countries facing balance of payments difficulties or currency pressures. The CRA has a total size of US$100 billion, with China contributing 41%, Brazil, Russia and India 18% each, and South Africa 5%. The CRA aims to complement the existing international financial safety net, such as the IMF, and to strengthen the regional financial stability of BRICS. ⁴</p><p id="80eff757-f46c-4b4d-9b1c-cb5bd23ef30a" class="">Another example of monetary policy coordination among BRICS countries is the BRICS payment system project, which aims to create a common platform for cross-border payments and settlements among BRICS currencies. The project was initiated by Russia in 2019 and is expected to be launched by 2023. The project intends to reduce transaction costs, enhance efficiency, and promote financial inclusion among BRICS countries.

First, BRICS countries have different monetary policy regimes and frameworks, which reflect their diverse economic structures and conditions. For example, China has a managed floating exchange rate regime with capital controls, while Brazil has a floating exchange rate regime with inflation targeting. These differences imply that BRICS countries may have conflicting or diverging monetary policy preferences and responses to common or idiosyncratic shocks. Second, BRICS countries have different degrees of monetary policy autonomy and credibility, which affect their ability and willingness to coordinate their monetary policies. For example, China has a high degree of monetary policy autonomy and credibility, as it has a large domestic market, a strong central bank, and a stable currency. In contrast, South Africa has a low degree of monetary policy autonomy and credibility, as it has a small and open economy, a weak central bank, and a volatile currency. These differences imply that BRICS countries may have asymmetric costs and benefits from monetary policy coordination. Third, BRICS countries face various political and institutional constraints and challenges for monetary policy coordination. For example, BRICS countries have different levels of political stability and governance quality, which affect their policy consistency and predictability. Moreover, BRICS countries have different degrees of institutional development and capacity, which affect their policy implementation and enforcement.</p><p id="0c360f2a-bd26-473c-ba9e-1339703fb346" class="">Therefore, monetary policy coordination among BRICS countries requires a careful balance between cooperation and sovereignty, as well as between flexibility and commitment. It also requires a gradual and pragmatic approach that considers the heterogeneity and complexity of BRICS economies.</p><h3 id="4387de63-5028-4acb-99e4-f43c820b75f3" class=""><strong>Fiscal Policy Coordination</strong></h3><p id="2fd0bbbf-1a68-49cb-93d5-f012ea7e89dc" class="">Fiscal policy coordination refers to the alignment of fiscal policy objectives and instruments among countries in order to achieve common goals, such as fiscal sustainability, macroeconomic stability, public goods provision, and economic growth. Fiscal policy coordination can enhance economic integration by reducing fiscal spillovers, mitigating external shocks, facilitating fiscal transfers and redistribution, and promoting regional public goods.</p><p id="b4bc665c-3175-4e3f-ad81-e93e855db482" class="">BRICS countries have taken some steps to coordinate their fiscal policies in recent years. For instance, they have established the New Development Bank (NDB), a multilateral development bank that provides financing for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies. The NDB has an initial authorized capital of US$100 billion, with equal shares among the five members. The NDB aims to complement the existing multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and to address the financing gap for infrastructure investment in developing countries.</p><p id="80b6ebe1-586a-4440-ad98-7fdedab33aff" class="">Another example of fiscal policy coordination among BRICS countries is the BRICS tax policy cooperation project, which aims to enhance tax transparency and cooperation among BRICS countries. The project was initiated by India in 2012 and has resulted in several outcomes, such as the BRICS Tax Report, the BRICS Tax Directory, the BRICS Tax Database, and the BRICS Tax Forum. The project intends to facilitate information exchange, capacity building, best practices sharing, and policy dialogue among BRICS tax authorities.</p><p id="6a28992a-2bad-400d-b44f-abd328f73e68" class="">However, there are significant challenges and limitations for fiscal policy coordination among BRICS countries. First, BRICS countries have different fiscal policy regimes and frameworks, which reflect their diverse fiscal positions and needs. For example, China has a relatively low fiscal deficit and debt ratio, while Brazil has a relatively high fiscal deficit and debt ratio. These differences imply that BRICS countries may have conflicting or diverging fiscal policy preferences and responses to common or idiosyncratic shocks. Second, BRICS countries have different degrees of fiscal policy autonomy and credibility, which affect their ability and willingness to coordinate their fiscal policies. For example, India has a high degree of fiscal policy autonomy and credibility, as it has a strong parliament, an independent audit institution, and a credible fiscal rule. In contrast, Russia has a low degree of fiscal policy autonomy and credibility, as it has a weak legislature, a politicized audit institution, and a volatile fiscal rule. These differences imply that BRICS countries may have asymmetric costs and benefits from fiscal policy coordination.

BRICS countries should also strengthen the role and function of the NDB as a regional development bank that supports the financing needs of BRICS and other emerging economies.</li></ul><ul id="a9235964-80af-4410-8923-66e46189461f" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">BRICS countries should continue to improve their monetary policy coordination by enhancing their information exchange and consultation mechanisms on monetary policy issues of common interest, such as exchange rate movements, inflation expectations, and financial stability risks. BRICS countries should also strengthen the role and function of the CRA as a regional financial safety net that provides liquidity support to member countries facing balance of payments difficulties or currency pressures.</li></ul><ul id="6b9ddc03-63fe-476e-8810-b7391805d84e" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">BRICS countries should continue to advance their fiscal policy coordination by enhancing their information exchange and consultation mechanisms on fiscal policy issues of common interest, such as fiscal sustainability, public debt management, and public goods provision. BRICS countries should also strengthen their tax policy cooperation by facilitating information exchange, capacity building, best practices sharing, and policy dialogue among tax authorities.</li></ul><ul id="370e1284-4b3c-4bdd-bb64-c084aeaeb808" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">BRICS countries should continue to foster their trade policy coordination by enhancing their information exchange and consultation mechanisms on trade policy issues of common interest, such as market access, trade facilitation, and trade diversification. BRICS countries should also strengthen their trade policy cooperation by supporting multilateral trade negotiations under the WTO framework and engaging in bilateral or plurilateral trade negotiations with other regions or countries.</li></ul><p id="ddd61c46-9475-4be0-a336-5201dcf29abb" class="">By implementing these recommendations, BRICS countries can enhance their economic integration and policy coordination, and move closer towards the goal of becoming an optimum currency area in the future.</p><h2 id="0d5e7f80-a657-4738-9fc0-4a836b9ae9a2" class=""><strong>Limitations</strong></h2><p id="0fec68d2-0502-4e15-a0c3-6456d009ce9f" class="">This paper has some limitations that should be acknowledged and addressed in future research. First, this paper has used a limited number of indicators and data sources to measure the degree of economic integration and policy coordination among BRICS countries. Future research could use more comprehensive and updated indicators and data sources to capture the dynamic and complex nature of BRICS economic relations. Second, this paper has focused on the aggregate level of analysis and has not examined the country-specific or sector-specific aspects of economic integration and policy coordination among BRICS countries. Future research could conduct more in-depth and nuanced analysis of the heterogeneity and diversity of BRICS economies and their implications for economic integration and policy coordination. Third, this paper has adopted a descriptive and analytical approach and has not employed any formal models or empirical methods to test the causal relationships or quantify the effects of economic integration and policy coordination among BRICS countries. Future research could use more rigorous and robust models and methods to provide more evidence-based and policy-relevant insights for BRICS cooperation.</p><h2 id="97f52dee-be3a-466e-936d-1e0f8cb8edc7" class=""><strong>References</strong></h2><ol type="1" id="c6a162fb-6214-4356-af77-bbffc9ace14b" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Hooijmaaijers, B.
